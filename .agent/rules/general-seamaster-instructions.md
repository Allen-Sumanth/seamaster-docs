The general prompt guidelines are in the agent/ directory. The directory contains all the relevant source code in order to write the documentation for the game. The agent/ directory contains two folders, which are in itself repositories: 
src/ : this is the python library source code, we're documenting the use of this library only. 
oceanmaster-coderunner-master/ : this is the backend game engine, which verifies and 'plays' all the moves.

Use these as your primary context when developing the documentation.
